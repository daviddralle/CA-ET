# CA-ET

Dataset and code required to replicate analysis in the manuscript *How Much Water is Evaporated Across California?: A Multi-Year Assessment Using a Biophysical Model Forced with Satellite Remote Sensing Data* by D. Baldocchi, D. Dralle, C. Jiang, and Y. Ryu, in *Water Resources Research*. 

Data extraction is performed via the Python Google Earth Engine API in the [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) `/notebooks/extract_crop_et_data.ipynb`. Data plotting and analysis of water year evapotranspiration can be found in the notebook `/notebooks/plot_data.ipynb`. Saved water year data can be found in the `/data` folder. ET is reported in units of millimeters. 

BESS ET dataset information can be found on Google Earth Engine [here](https://code.earthengine.google.com/?asset=users/daviddralle/bessv2). The Earth Engine asset ID is `users/daviddralle/bessv2`. The dataset is publicly accessible.
