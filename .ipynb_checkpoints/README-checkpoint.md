Dataset and code required to replicate analysis in the manuscript *How Much Water is Evaporated Across California?:  A Multi-Year Assessment Using a Biophysical Model Forced with Satellite Remote Sensing Data* by D. Baldocchi, D. Dralle, G. de sa Queen, C. Jiang, and Y. Ryu.

The file `python3_environment.yml` includes the package list required to run the included python notebooks. Once you have Anaconda (<http://anaconda.org>) on your machine, you can install this particular environment with `conda env create -f anaconda_environment_indirectStorage_py3.yml`. To learn more about how to use the `conda` command and environments, go to <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html>.
